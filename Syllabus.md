## Course Description
Digital Modeling is the process of using software to create a computerized representation of a 3-dimensional object. The created object is called a 3D model and these 3-dimensional models can be sculpted and altered in interesting and unique ways using a computer. In this course, students will explore a suite of foundational computer programs such as Blender and Autodesk Fusion360 that enable the creation of digital models. These tools are fundamental to the 3D pipeline and allow room for artistic expression and creativity that lead to new ways of thinking. Also introduced in the course are techniques such as photogrammetry and 3D-scanning which are methods of capturing real world objects for use in the digital realm. The class uses hands-on learning and is structured around a series of engaging projects that challenge creativity. Topics covered include mesh sculpting, nurbs-modeling, texturing, rendering, and photogrammetry.  A personal laptop is required for this course.
## Objectives
* Learn about the 3D modeling ecosystem; the tools, techniques, and use cases
* Overcome the learning curves that are usually present in 3D modeling software
* Build up the skill with hours of 3D modeling and sculpting practice
* Capture textures in the field and incorporate them into your digital modeling workflow
* Employ methods of bringing real-world objects into the digital 3D space
* Survey techniques in photogrammetry and 3D scanning
* Feel comfortable using these tools and techniques in an artistic, creative and expressive context
* Explore artists already working in this space and learn about their works

## Assessment
Students will be assessed on their performance in the course through the completion of four projects as well as in-class exercises. Each day, we will begin with a short lecture followed by work time using a computer and software. Projects will be assigned concurrent with daily exercises and the skills we learn in class will be directly applicable to the project theme. Homework assignments may consist of watching video tutorials, reading material, and researching topics. Plan on spending a few hours each week working on assigned course content outside of class-time.
## Roadmap
The calendar provided will be your roadmap to the topics and assignments introduced during each class. The calendar is a dynamic work in progress and is subject to changes as the course progresses. The instructor will review the calendar at the start of each class and any changes will be announced then. As such, it is important to attend each class and communicate with your peers about something you might have missed because of an absence. The calendar will be available online.  
## Projects
There will be 4 projects during the semester (as time allows). For each project, you will receive a project sheet that contains all the necessary information needed to complete the assignment, such as guidelines, requirements, and helpful tips, including how to submit the finished work. Some projects may require sketching ideas out on paper or digitally in order to communicate the concept to the professor for approval. You are to work independently on your project unless otherwise stated as a group effort. All work created for this course must be your own and any copying/borrowing of other people's work, physical or digital, must be disclosed. Taking work from the internet and presenting it as your own is not permitted and is a potential plagiarism violation. Each project will be submitted in a digital format as detailed by the project sheet.
Required Reading/Watching materials
Many of the topics presented in this course have excellent resources available online for supplemental learning. PDF manuals, video tutorials, and website resources will be presented throughout the course in place of a dedicated textbook. Links to these materials will be provided during the associated lecture and will also be made available online via shared links.
## Required Materials
* A laptop which you will bring to class to use for in-class exercises. The laptop must have the basic requirements to install and run the required software on it (see below), and must be able to connect to the internet.
* A power/charging cable for your laptop is a must. 3D modeling is resource intensive and laptop batteries are drained quickly. We will have multiple power outlets available to charge the laptops during class.
* An iPad or Surface tablet computer is not sufficient for the course, and therefore not permitted. The device must have a mouse and keyboard.
* A 3-button mouse ( a mouse with a scroll wheel that is also “clickable”) is required.Find your own or buy a cheap one like this: 3-Button Mouse on Amazon
## Minimum specs
The minimum requirements for a laptop to run the software that is required for the course is below. We will go over this information in class at the start of the semester, including how to check the specs of your own laptop device.
* Runs on Windows 8.1 and 10 or macOS 10.13 or later
* 64-bit dual core 2Ghz CPU with SSE2 support (32-bit not supported) (any Intel Core i or AMD Ryzen cpu will suffice)  
* 4 GB RAM
* 1280×768 display
* Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet
* Graphics card with 1 GB RAM, OpenGL 3.3
* 3 GB of storage
* Less than 10 year old
## Grading
* Projects: 60%
* In-Class exercises: 20%
* Homework: 10%
* Attendance 10%
Opportunities for extra credit are available where appropriate
## Attendance
Students are expected to attend each class. A late arrival or early departure will count as an absence.
*3 unexcused absences = 1 full letter drop of final grade*
Students with excessive absences (5 or more) will be dropped from the course. Students are expected to attend all classes, except in cases of emergency, grave illness, religious commitment, or pre-planned events of critical importance. In the case of a planned absence, notify me. For illnesses, provide documentation whenever possible. For any absence, it is the student’s responsibility to inquire with classmates for notes, to make up any exercises missed, and to complete impending assignments.This course contains a great deal of technical content which is cumulative in nature. Regular attendance and active participation in the class are essential and catching up is difficult. Come to class prepared to engage in active discussion; bring questions, feedback, and inspiration for yourself and your classmates.
## Excused Absence Policy
Regular class attendance, participation, and engagement in coursework are important contributors to student success. Absences may be excused as provided in the University of Houston Undergraduate Excused Absence Policy and Graduate Excused Absence Policy for reasons including: medical illness of student or close relative, death of a close family member, legal or government proceeding that a student is obligated to attend, recognized professional and educational activities where the student is presenting, and University-sponsored activity or athletic competition. Under these policies, students with excused absences will be provided with an opportunity to make up any quiz, exam or other work that contributes to the course grade or a satisfactory alternative. Please read the full policy for details regarding reasons for excused absences, the approval process, and extended absences. Additional policies address absences related to military service, religious holy days, pregnancy and related conditions, and disability.

If you have an accommodation to record class-related activities, those recordings may not be shared with any other student, whether in this course or not, or with any other person or on any other platform. Classes may be recorded by the instructor. Students may use instructor’s recordings for their own studying and notetaking. Instructor’s recordings are not authorized to be shared with  anyone without the prior written approval of the instructor. Failure to comply with requirements regarding recordings will result in a disciplinary referral to the Dean of Students Office and may result in disciplinary action.
